# Image-compression-using-SVD-and-dimensionality-reduction-using-PCA

Goal of this academic project is to implement the Image compression using SVD and Dimensionality reduction of any dataset using PCA.

## Data should be placed in the data folder and all the generated outputs will also store in the data folder.
## Conversion from ascii-binary-ascii and Image compression using SVD and Error calculations are coded in Java.
## Java files used - SVD.java, Utils.java and DecomposeMatrix.java.
## SVD is our main java class which separates the given tasks.
## DecomposeMatrix class in DecomposeMatrix.java file decomposes the given matrix into U,S,VT and saves the header.txt and SVD.txt
## Utils.java file has the few methods like saveCompressedFileToBin, readCompressedBin, convertFloatToHalfPrecision.
## Note -- PGM file should not have comment line.
## jblas.jar is a matrix library for Java
